## Progress
***(Refer to the GitHub repository's commit history to track the raw progress of code development.)***

**25/12/2024:** 
- Started logging progress
- Added checkbounds (making sure snake stays within window boundaries) for the snake, as well as successfully learning how to utilise ArrayList for Rectangles (snake segments), and updating coordinates for them.
- Learned how to use ActionListener and KeyListener as well as timer to create the project.
